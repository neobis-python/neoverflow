## Summary <a name = "summary"></a>

We need to create a simple bot that will handle q&a within the private messages and group chats.

## Background <a name = "background"></a>

I was wondering why most of the newcomers at neobis don't ask questions. I believe some of them are too shy for this, being publicly humiliated for asking a stupid question is a big deal for them (even though it's not like that at all). And this thought brought me to the idea of creating a solution that will help 'em to do it anonymously via the bot.
